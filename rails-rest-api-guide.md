# Rails REST API Guide

## Introduction
This guide covers the implementation of RESTful APIs using Rails, focusing on best practices and patterns.

## Basic REST API Concepts
- **Resources**: Understanding the concept of resources in REST.
- **HTTP Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

## Advanced REST API Scenarios
### Bulk Operations
- **Definition**: Bulk operations allow multiple records to be created, updated, or deleted in a single API call.
- **Implementation**: Use arrays in the request body and process them accordingly.

### State Machines
- **Definition**: State machines can be used to manage the state transitions of resources.
- **Implementation**: Integrate gems like `aasm` to handle complex state transitions in your API.

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Definition**: This approach decouples the components of the application, allowing for asynchronous processing.
- **Implementation**: Utilize tools like RabbitMQ or AWS SNS/SQS to trigger events based on API calls.

### Complex Filtering
- **Definition**: Allow clients to filter resources using various parameters.
- **Implementation**: Implement query parameters such as `?status=active&sort=created_at`.

### File Uploads
- **Definition**: Handling file uploads through your API.
- **Implementation**: Use Active Storage or CarrierWave to manage file uploads.

### Webhooks
- **Definition**: Webhooks allow real-time notifications to clients when certain events occur.
- **Implementation**: Create endpoints to receive webhook calls and process them accordingly.

### Rate Limiting
- **Definition**: Limit the number of requests a client can make to your API.
- **Implementation**: Use Rack::Attack to implement rate limiting strategies.

### Multi-Tenancy
- **Definition**: Support multiple clients or tenants with a single instance of your application.
- **Implementation**: Use subdomains or request headers to differentiate between tenants.

### Advanced Error Handling Patterns
- **Definition**: Provide meaningful error responses to the clients.
- **Implementation**: Use custom error classes and render JSON responses with error details.

## Conclusion
This guide provides a roadmap for implementing complex REST API scenarios in Rails. By following these patterns, developers can create robust and scalable APIs.
